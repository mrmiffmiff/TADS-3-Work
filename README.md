# TADS-3-Work
Just various work I'm doing as I teach myself TADS 3 for Text Adventure Development, mostly examples and exercises, may include actual games of my own at some point.

Honestly, it's just my particular work as I work through learning. If you want to use it, go ahead, but you're better off learning yourself.

As I'm already a confident programmer, my learning materials are as follows:
The TADS 3 Quick start Guide
Up to the End of Chapter 2 of Getting Started in TADS 3
Learning TADS 3
TADS 3 Tour Guide
And then the TADS 3 manuals (System Manual, Technical Manual, Library Reference Manual)
